# AB-Testing-Project

A large company with a substantial user base plans to increase sales through advertisement on its website. However, they still have not made up their minds about whether the ads increase sales or not. In order to determine whether this is the case, 20000 customers were subjected to A/B testing for 31 days. The company wants to know if the ads have a significant impact on sales.

The analysis consisted of the following parts:

**Data Loading**

**Data Cleaning and Processing**

**Data Profiling**

**Making Hypotheses**

**Data Analysis**

**Data Visualization**
